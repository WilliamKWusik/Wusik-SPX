 Open-Source File Format Definition and Editor
 
Here you will find the definition of the format plus a full free open-source editor. There's no player yet, but soon there will be one. The player will not be open-source. You will need a license to be able to distribute your sounds with the player. Or, you can create your own player. The use of the file format is free and not tied to the player in any way. The editor doesn't feature sample manipulation. So you need to use something like Ocean Audio to edit and loop your sounds. https://www.ocenaudio.com/
