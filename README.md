 Open-Source File Format Definition and Editor

Here you will find the definition of the format plus a full free open-source editor. There's no player yet, but soon there will be one. The player will not be open-source. You will need a license to be able to distribute your sounds with the player. Or, you can create your own player. The use of the file format is free and not tied to the player in any way. The editor doesn't feature sample manipulation. So you need to use something like Ocean Audio to edit and loop your sounds. https://www.ocenaudio.com/

Check the Releases folder for the Application (.exe) and VST2/VST3 Plugins. Again, this is an EDITOR, to create presets + sounds. Not the actual PLAYER.

When IMPORTING sound files (WAV,AIFF,OGG,MP3,FLAC) you can name those in the following format for easier key/velocity zone setup.

- MY SAMPLE_000_127_000_127_060.wav
- MY SAMPLE_LLL_HHH_VLL_VHH_KRR.wav
- LLL: Key Low
- HHH: Key High
- VLL: Velocity Low
- VHH: Velocity High
- KRR: Key Root

Always keep in a 000 format, so 000 to 127. When you load a sound file the editor will only save the filename and path location. It wonâ€™t save any sound data. So keep the original files until you finish up the project. You can save to a BUNDLE format which will save the sound data information along.
