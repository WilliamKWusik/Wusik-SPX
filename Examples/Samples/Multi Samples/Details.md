When IMPORTING multi sound files (WAV,AIFF,OGG,MP3,FLAC) you can name those in the following format for easier key/velocity zone setup.

- MY SAMPLE_000_127_000_127_060.wav
- MY SAMPLE_LLL_HHH_VLL_VHH_KRR.wav
- LLL: Key Low
- HHH: Key High
- VLL: Velocity Low
- VHH: Velocity High
- KRR: Key Root

Always keep in a 000 format, so 000 to 127. When you load a sound file the editor will only save the filename and path location. It wonâ€™t save any sound data. So keep the original files until you finish up the project. You can save to a BUNDLE format which will save the sound data information along.
